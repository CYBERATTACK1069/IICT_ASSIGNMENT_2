*   **Main:** The main content of the page is enclosed in the `<main>` tag. It is divided into several sections:
    *   A "hero" section with a prominent heading and a call-to-action button.
    *   A section with four articles, each containing an icon and a short description.
    *   A section with a product card that includes an image, a description, and the price.
    *   A section with various form elements, including checkboxes for interests, radio buttons for language selection, and a dropdown for car selection.
    *   A "customer review" section with a form for users to submit their name, email, rating, and a review.
*   **Footer:** A placeholder for the footer content.

The HTML uses semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<nav>` to structure the content, making it more accessible and easier to understand for both browsers and developers.
